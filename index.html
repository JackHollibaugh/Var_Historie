                    V책r Historie was founded in 2014 by Nora Hansen, a professional Rosemaling award winner and instructor, with the hope of bringing the traditional art forms of her home, Norway,<br> to younger generations.<br> Over the years, dozens of other passionate artists have joined in her mission. Together, we have taught workshops and held events at schools, community centers, and museums across the country.

                                        <p class=storetext> V책r Historie's online marketplace helps us to not only buy supplies and space, but to continue supporting artists as well. Our selection of student work is all donated, but we also have a range of work from Norwegian artists. Our goal is not only to raise money for our workshops, but to give exposure and support to Norwegian artists making work today.</p>
